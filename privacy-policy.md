PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy governs the collection, use, and sharing of personal information by DecentApp, a mobile application that allows users to post images and earn cryptocurrency rewards in the form of the Decent token. DecentApp is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and ensuring that personal information is handled responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
DecentApp collects users passphrase (only necessary if wallet is imported not created) to import a user’s wallet so that all transactions performed on our DecentApp will be done using that wallet. Blockchain transactions require a user’s private key, so the user’s private key is fetched from their wallet passphrase. The passphrase is solely used for this purpose; we do not store a copy of the user's phrase anywhere.

USE OF INFORMATION
The information collected by DecentApp is used solely to enable users to use the DecentApp and to provide its services. We do not share personal information with third parties.

PROTECTION OF INFORMATION
We protect personal information by not saving a copy at all. When a user logs out of our DecentApp, all of their information will be erased, and they will need to submit their passphrase or create a new one upon the next login. Each user is entirely in charge of their personal information. We do not use cookies or any tracking technologies on our mobile apps.
